1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

I was asked to create an interface for the wildlife zoo using the C Plus and the provided java code. The program needed to call the java code to generate a file or load from a file. The interface includes the ability to create new data, delete data, display and or updated file contents, and if the data is good save data to file. I need to create functions for each element that was asked for and a switch within the menu function that would call the specific function that the user wanted. 

2. What did you do particularly well?

I think I was able to meet expectations with what was called for. I was able to contain everything within functions and only had two line of code within main. This shows that I understand the need to compartmentalize code within functions to have clean code. 

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

If I were to enhance this code, I would add classes and use a linked list to control the data. This will more control over the data and it is easier to manipulate the data. Using a class structure with different files will allow me to secure the data better by making it private within the classes and have more control on what is public. 

4. Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

I think the most difficult thing I ran into in writing this code was removing an element from a vector. It took me a lot of research and trial and error to figure it out. Finally, I was able to make it work by using a vector iterator and .erase(). Cplus.com and stackoverflow.com are two sites I will continue to use to figure out how certain things work. 

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

To manipulate a vector is the skill that I learned with this project. by understanding on how to load a vector from a file and adding and removing elements will make this very important in the future. 

6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made this program maintainable readable and adaptable by using functions whenever I could. This way each option is modifiable within the function and it will be changed everywhere that function is used.
